Assignment Description:
	- Dealer and player both get a hand. Player will go first.
	- Use a random number generator to give the player two numbers ranging form 2 to 11
	- Give player option to stay or add another number to try and get closer to 21.
	- If they go over 21, they bust and lose.
	- After the player loses or stays, the deaer goes. The dealer has to add new numbers
	to their original hand until they reach 17 or higher. If they go over 21, they lose.
	- Once the player and dealer have a number that isn't above 21 and neither have lost,
	the program will compare the two numbers, with the higher number being the winner.
	- A tie between numbers results in the dealer winning.
	- If the player or the dealer manages to get 5 cards in hand and still be less than or
	equal to 21, its an automatic win for that person. 
	- That means that the player or dealer cannot have more than 5 cards.
	- The program should continuously loop by asking the player "Deal another hand?"
	until they say no.
